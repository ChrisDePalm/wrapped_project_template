# PWM FET Drivers

This is a Zerotoasic MPW2 project submission to Google/Efabless/Skywater shuttle program.

This project includes four PWM FET drivers.  The intended application is for multi-channel power supplies, motor-driver, H-bridge, and digital to analog applications.

Features Include:
> - Four independently controllable PWM generators.
> - 32-Bit Wishbone Interface
> - Four independent voltage and current limit inputs
> - Three emergency shut-down fault inputs
> - Adjustable prescaler (1:1 to 1:128)
